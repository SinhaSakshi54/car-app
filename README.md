Cirtru Assignment
1. The web page should include 24 listings of cars
2. Each listing should contain an image of the car, year of the car (e.g. 2022), make of the car (e.g. Maruti), model of the car (e.g. Ertiga) and selling price of the car
3. The page should also include a filter that includes Year, Make, Model and Price. So basically if I apply filter with Year 2022, I should only see listings of cars that are of 2022 Year
